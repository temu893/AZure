## Remote State and Backend that I used in my day 5,6 and 7 Terraform project

**What is it?**
Remote state in Terraform refers to storing the state file in a remote backend, such as an Azure Storage Account, instead of locally on your machine. This allows multiple team members to access and modify the same state file, ensuring consistency and preventing conflicts.

Backend is the configuration that defines where and how this state is stored and how operations like locking and state management are handled.


**How I implemented it:**
To implement remote state in Terraform, I configured a backend in my Terraform configuration file. For example, to use an Azure Storage Account as the backend, I added the following block to my `main.tf` file:
// filepath: main.tf
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "my-rg"
    storage_account_name = "mystorageaccount"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```hcl
I initialized the backend with terraform init to migrate local state to remote.

**Why it matters:**
Remote state allows Terraform to store the state of your infrastructure in a remote location, which is crucial for collaboration and consistency across teams. It solves problems related to state file management, such as preventing conflicts when multiple users are working on the same infrastructure.
